Speaker Recognition

Speaker recognition is the task of automatically recognizing who is speaking using speaker specific features. It is being studied for number of decades due to various practical applications in number of fields like customer services, security verification, forensics, home automation and many more.

I have explored two approaches, using Gaussian Mixture Model and Universal Background Model (GMM-UBM) based approach and more advanced technique using lower dimensional i-vector. You can find codes in individual folders. More details about both the approaches and comparison between results are present in given report.
