This is an implementation of phoneme level HMM in continuous form. Here each phoneme is represented by 4 state HMM out of which three are emitting states and one is non emitting state. I have implemented forward, backward and viterbi algorithms on this HMM. I have trained two HMM each for word "zero" and "one" on given data and tested them to recognize the word. It is giving 100% accuracy.
