This is implementation of phoneme level HMM in continous form. Here each phoneme is represented by 4 state HMM out of which 3 are emitting state and one 1 is non emitting state. I have implemented forward, backward and viterbi algorithms on this HMM. I have trained two HMM for zero and one word on given data and tested it to recognize word. It is giving 100% accuracy.
